## FIBRIL

**Decentralized global creator support platform that allows fans to support Creators with Cryptocurrencies and NFTs**

Basically, a "Decentralized Patreon"

### Problem

The current and most popular creator support platforms are centralized and not censorship resistand. There have been many reports of these platforms suspending and deplatforming creators, which make it impossible for the creators to access their funds.

Also, Some of these platforms are not available in some regions and countries which leaves the creators in those regions/countries at a disadvantage.

### Solution
The solution built is a decentralized creator support platform.

Fibril is a decentralized creator support platform that allows fans (A.K.A supporters) to support their favorite creators and idols with crypto tokens and NFTs.

Creators and Supporters can access the platform from any region/country in the world without any fear of account suspension or deplatforming because the core and main features of the platform are smart contracts written and deployed to the blockchain network.

Creators can be supported with crypto tokens which are MATIC, DAI, USDT and USDC. They can also be supported with NFTs.

Support with the crypto tokens makes it very easy for supporters to support their creators across border without the hassle of converting their local currencies into that of the creators.
Also, Using crypto tokens makes it easy for creators to withdraw their funds and convert it back to their local currencies with great ease in any exchange.

Some of the current features of Fibril:

- Dashboard (for creators)
- Creator support with crypto tokens
- Creator support with NFTs
- Selling of NFTs by creators
- Buying of creators NFTs

- Creation of support links (payment links but for supporting creators)
- Random reward of supporters (randomness powered by Chainlink VRF)
